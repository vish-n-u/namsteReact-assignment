Q1) What is Lazy() When and Why Do we Need?
Ans) Parcel creates a dist folder that contains all the code of your react project 
and sends that to the browser, which the browse reads and paints the DOM with, But this
takes a lot of time , suppose there are loosely coupled features in the app, and you don't 
necessarily need them to be loaded unless there is a need for them to be loaded because
there might be performance issue
